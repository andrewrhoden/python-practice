Handling Files
For this lab, imagine you are an IT Specialist at a medium-sized company. 
The Human Resources Department at your company wants you to find out how many people are in each department.
 You need to write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a list of the employees in the organization, 
 counts how many people are in each department, and then generates a report using this information. 
The output of this script will be a plain text file. We will guide you through each step of the lab.'''
